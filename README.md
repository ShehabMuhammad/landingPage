# checklist
**What was done**
- [x] navigation menu created using javascript
- [x] used camelCase method of naming variable, and used const and let most often, meangingful names were chosen,
- [x] added an extra section, highlighting for active section
- [x] used markdown syntax for this readme.md file for example, 2 asterisk to make a bold phrase, and provided basic information
- [x] I inserted several comments Which I believed were helpful.
- [x] I highlighted the activeSection as much as I could, As well as the navigation element that corresponds to it. (colorful borders and white background respectively).
- [x] I added some collapsible elements such as FAQ, and About section with readMore/readLess buttons.
- [x] I added a go to top button (Top), That only appears when you're at least 50 pixels away from the top.
- [x] I added a navigation side bar, as well as navigation bar in the header, That prevents default when clicked so it won't go to the href.
- [x] The Scrolling is smooth.
- [x] I added a slides show that I made specifically for the project And a game that I was working on before.
